        <!-- Overview -->
        <h2 class="mb-3">Overview</h2>
            <p> Welcome to my responsive redesign project submission page! 
                This is my first project that actually combined design and coding. 
                I am also pretty new to actually deploying usable and accessibility websites 
                using HTML and CSS. Objectives of this project were to develop my ability to 
                critique and identify problems with an existing website design, create prototypes of 
                different screen sizes at high and low fidelity, and finally develop a responsive 
                website from those prototypes.
            </p>

        <!-- Part 1 -->
        <h2 class="mb-3">Part 1. Identifying Usability Problems </h2>
            <p> I picked the website of a local business, Metro Nails Salon. I chose this website 
                because it seems a bit rudimentary and needs some fixing, from the functional aspects 
                to the design of the layout. You can find the link to the original website 
                <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/metronails/home">here</a>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mb-3">Finding Problems</h3>
                <div class="row mb-5"> <!-- row added to wrap columns -->
                    <!-- Column 1 -->
                    <div class="col">
                        <h4> Efficiency, Memorability, Learnability </h4>
                        <p> In evaluating the salon's website, I focused on three core usability principles: 
                            Efficiency, Learnability, and Memorability. Efficiency measures how quickly users 
                            can achieve their goals on the site, like locating information or booking services,
                            with minimal effort. Learnability assesses the ease with which first-time visitors 
                            can grasp and navigate the site. Finally, memorability gauges the user's ability to 
                            recall how to use the website effectively after an initial visit: this ensures that 
                            they can navigate it with ease even if they return infrequently. 
                        </p>

                    </div>

                    <!-- Column 2 -->
                    <div class="col">
                        <img src="assets/analysis.jpeg" class="img-fluid mt-4" alt="Responsive image">
                    </div>
                </div> <!-- Closing row div -->

                

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col">
                        <h4> Accessibility </h4>
                        <p> In addition to analyzing usability based on the three aforementioned principles, I also 
                            used WebAIM WAVE to detect potential accessibility problems. The problems detected 
                            are 10 low contrast errors, and 3 missing alternative texts. WAVE also detected 
                            inappropriately sized text (too small). I partially agree with the detected problems 
                            â€” the low contrast errors and lack of alternative texts for the pictures would affect 
                            colorblind and the visually impaired. However, I do believe that the small text is an 
                            intentional design choice as they are a brief description of the source of the stock 
                            photos used to advertise the salon. 
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="col">
                        <img src="assets/wave_analysis.png" class="img-fluid mt-4" alt="Responsive image">
                    </div>
                </div>

            <h3 class="mb-2 mt-4">Conclusion</h3>
                <p> Overall, the website shows potential in efficiency and learnability but requires significant 
                    improvements in accessibility and certain functional aspects to enhance user experience.
                </p>
